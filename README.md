### Trip 🛫

### Required features:
-  Create a “Destination” entity with the following fields: name,
description, price, duration of the trip, image of the destination. These fields should not be nullable
- Set up a database to store destinations
- Create a home page that displays the list of destination destinations
honeymoon with their images and descriptions. Each destination should have a link so the user can click and access to the details of the destination
- Allow users to click on a destination to view the full details of that destination.
- Implement a basic authentication system for administrators.
- Add a backoffice where administrators can create, update and delete destinations.
- Add validation rule on the destination creation
- Expose a REST API for Destination, the API should be public that means no security token is needed
- We can filter the API per destination and name
- Create a Symfony command that GET all destinations via the API and export them into a CSV like the example below
- Add tests and tooling

| name  | description                        | price | duration |
|-------|------------------------------------|-------|----------|
